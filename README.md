# ArchitectureSandbox
Sandbox for solutions of common problems in android development.
Also can be used as template for new projects.

## Already Ã®mplemented:
- MVP exmaple
- simple dagger (yet unacceptable for large multimodule project's)
- modulization concept
- Google Architecture Navigation example + self navigation

## To be implemented someday:
- MVVM
- BottomNavigationView
- Drawer navigation
- Dynamic delivery feature
- DeepLink handling
- Work with languages (easy support for new in modulizes app)
- UI test's on [kaspresso](https://github.com/KasperskyLab/Kaspresso)
- migrate to [Rx3](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxKotlin)
- update library versions
- Error handling on presentation layer example
- mock api server as interceptor and as standalone app (smth similar to how [LeakCanary](https://github.com/square/leakcanary) works)
